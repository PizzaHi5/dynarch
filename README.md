# Project

UPDATE THIS!!!

I decided to build a fun project focused on trying to build a dynamically constructing langgraph workflow. It started with a user prompt provided to a supervisor agent that breaks the problem down into high level objectives. 

Each objective gets assigned to new agents that work to accomplish the task. Depending on the task/objective assigned, a different type of agent is created.
